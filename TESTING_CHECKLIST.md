# Document Processing Testing Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive validation approach for the PDF AI Assistant document processing system.

## Pre-Testing Setup ✅

- [ ] Development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Database is accessible (Supabase)
- [ ] Google Cloud Document AI is configured
- [ ] Pinecone vector database is accessible
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly

## 1. Basic Document Upload & Processing

### Small Document (Sync Processing)
- [ ] Upload a PDF document (1-10 pages, <15MB)
- [ ] Document appears in dashboard with "Uploading" or "Queued" status
- [ ] Real-time status updates show progression:
  - [ ] "Starting" phase
  - [ ] "Analyzing Document" phase  
  - [ ] "Extracting Data" phase
  - [ ] "Generating Embeddings" phase
- [ ] Progress bar advances through processing
- [ ] Time estimates are reasonable (1-2 minutes)
- [ ] Processing method shows "sync"
- [ ] Document completes with "Completed" status
- [ ] Extracted text is available
- [ ] Page count is accurate
- [ ] Similarity search works

### Large Document (Batch Processing)
- [ ] Upload a large PDF document (>15 pages or >15MB)
- [ ] Document initially tries sync processing
- [ ] System automatically switches to batch processing
- [ ] Status shows "Batch Processing" with appropriate message
- [ ] Processing method shows "batch"
- [ ] Time estimates are longer (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Progress indicator is appropriate for batch processing
- [ ] Document completes successfully
- [ ] All features work same as sync processed documents

## 2. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Page Limit Boundary Testing
- [ ] Upload document with exactly 15 pages
- [ ] Upload document with exactly 30 pages  
- [ ] System handles boundary conditions correctly
- [ ] Sync-to-batch switching works smoothly

### Network & Service Errors
- [ ] Temporarily disconnect internet during processing
- [ ] Verify system handles network timeouts gracefully
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Failed documents can be retried
- [ ] System doesn't crash or hang

### Invalid File Types
- [ ] Upload non-PDF file
- [ ] Upload corrupted PDF
- [ ] Upload password-protected PDF
- [ ] Appropriate error messages are shown

## 3. Real-Time Status Updates

### Status API Functionality
- [ ] `/api/documents/[id]/status` returns detailed status
- [ ] Status includes phase information
- [ ] Time estimates are provided
- [ ] Processing method is indicated
- [ ] Stale detection works (>5 minutes without update)

### Dashboard Live Updates
- [ ] Processing documents show live progress
- [ ] Auto-refresh indicator appears during processing
- [ ] Progress bars update in real-time
- [ ] Status messages are descriptive and helpful
- [ ] Updates stop when processing completes

## 4. Data Integrity & Search

### Document Processing Accuracy
- [ ] Extracted text matches PDF content
- [ ] Page count is correct
- [ ] Structured fields are extracted (if applicable)
- [ ] Business metadata is preserved
- [ ] Embeddings are generated successfully

### Search Functionality
- [ ] Similarity search returns relevant results
- [ ] Business metadata filters work correctly
- [ ] Page-level citations are accurate
- [ ] Search performance is acceptable

## 5. Performance & Reliability

### Processing Speed
- [ ] Small documents (1-5 pages): Complete in <2 minutes
- [ ] Medium documents (6-15 pages): Complete in <3 minutes  
- [ ] Large documents (batch): Complete in <15 minutes
- [ ] Multiple documents can process simultaneously

### System Stability
- [ ] Process multiple documents in sequence
- [ ] Process multiple documents simultaneously
- [ ] System remains responsive during heavy processing
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation

## 6. User Experience

### Dashboard Usability
- [ ] Document cards show clear status information
- [ ] Processing progress is visually appealing
- [ ] Time estimates help set user expectations
- [ ] Error states are clearly communicated
- [ ] Users can understand what's happening at all times

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Failed documents show clear error messages
- [ ] Users can retry failed processing
- [ ] System provides guidance for resolving issues
- [ ] Support contact information is available

## 7. Business Logic Validation

### Metadata Handling
- [ ] Law firm metadata is preserved
- [ ] Fund manager information is maintained
- [ ] Jurisdiction data is accurate
- [ ] Custom metadata fields work correctly

### Search Filters
- [ ] Business metadata filters function properly
- [ ] Combined filters work correctly
- [ ] Filter performance is acceptable
- [ ] Results are accurate and relevant

## Manual Testing Script

Run the automated testing script to validate core functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
node scripts/test-document-processing.js all

# Run specific test types
node scripts/test-document-processing.js sync
node scripts/test-document-processing.js batch
node scripts/test-document-processing.js status
node scripts/test-document-processing.js errors
```
